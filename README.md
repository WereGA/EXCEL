The dashboard is interactive and a brief description is as follows: -



i.                    The dashboard has three slicers; region, item type and sales channel.



ii.                  The first chart is a general summary of the units sold by region.



iii.                The second chart is a summary of the online and offline sales per quarter and can be used to identify peak seasons to inform stocking priorities, sales, discounts etc. In the first instance, it gives a summary of online and offline sales for all regions. It is viewed using the region and sales channel slicer for each region.



iv.                The third chart is a summary of revenue analysis by region. It compares total revenue against total cost and total profit. It is viewed using the region slicer for each region. Additional use of the sales channel slicer gives insights into a specific sales channel while the use of the item type slicer narrows it down to a specific item.



v.                  The fourth chart is a combination of item profits by region. The first appearance is a combination of the profits of all item types for all regions. The use of the region slicer shows profits of all item types for a specific region and the use of the sales channel slicer breaks this down further into either online or offline channels. It can also be read using the item type slicer as follows: -

a.       Item type + sales channel slicers give a reading for each item type for all regions.

b.      Region + Item type + Sales channel slicers give a reading for each item for a specific region.



vi.                The fifth chart shows total profits for items by sales channels. It complements chart 4. The first appearance gives a general summary of total profits for each item by sales channel. The use of the item type filter provides insights into the online and offline sales for a specific item while chart 4 shows profits from that item for all regions. As indicated above, to get sales channel insights you have to activate the sales channel slicer and use chart 4.



The charts are complementary such that a general analysis on chart 3 will bring general results for charts 4 and 5 and a specific region’s analysis will bring that region’s results.



The pivot tables are available but hidden for ease of presentation. They may be unhidden to enable you to understand my analysis and workings.
